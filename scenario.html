          <h1> Challenges </h1>
          <p>Extreme Heat: During the day, temperatures can soar to life-threatening levels (over 100°F / 38°C). Dehydration is a serious risk due to high temperatures and lack of water.</p>
          <p>Cold Nights: Deserts can experience dramatic temperature drops at night, leading to hypothermia if not properly prepared.</p>
          <p>Water Scarcity: Deserts often lack fresh water sources, so the primary concern is dehydration.</p>

        <div class="column1b2" tabindex="0">
          <h1> Challenges </h1>
          <p>Finding Food: While forests may offer more immediate access to food (fruits, plants, small animals), not all plants are safe to eat, and hunting or trapping may require skill.</p>
          <p>Weather Conditions: Weather can range from mild to extreme (cold winters, thunderstorms), requiring you to find or create shelter.</p>
          <p>Insects and Wildlife: Forests can have dangerous wildlife (bears, snakes) and insects that may pose a threat or hinder sleep.</p>
          <p>Navigation: Forests can be disorienting, and getting lost is a significant risk.</p>

        <div class="column2b3" tabindex="0">
          <h1> Challenges </h1>
          <p>Lack of Fresh Water: Without access to fresh water, you would need to rely on rainwater or find a way to desalinate seawater.</p>
          <p>Exposure to Elements: The ocean is a constant exposure to wind, sun, and saltwater. Prolonged sun exposure without shelter can lead to severe dehydration or sunburn.</p>
          <p>Sharks, Jellyfish, and Other Marine Hazards: Depending on your location, you might have to contend with dangerous marine life.</p>
          <p>Isolation: The vastness of the ocean means that finding rescue or land can take an extreme amount of time.</p>

        <div class="column1b4" tabindex="0">
          <h1> Challenges </h1>
          <p>Extreme Cold: The biggest threat in the Arctic is the cold, which can cause hypothermia and frostbite very quickly.</p>
          <p>Limited Food: The Arctic has very few natural food sources, and hunting is difficult due to the harsh conditions. You would rely heavily on any supplies you have or have access to.</p>
          <p>Daylight/Total Darkness: Depending on the season, you could be facing weeks of total darkness or unrelenting daylight, which can severely disrupt your circadian rhythm and ability to rest.</p>
          <p>Isolation: With extreme weather and few chances of rescue, the Arctic is an incredibly isolating place.</p>

        <div class="column2b5" tabindex="0">
          <h1> Challenges </h1>
          <p>Lack of Access to Clean Water: Drinkable water can be severely limited. Water sources can be contaminated by chemicals, bacteria, or debris, and natural water sources may become inaccessible due to flooding, damage, or destruction.</p>
          <p>Extreme environmental conditions: heat (in wildfires or deserts), cold (heavy storms), wind (from hurricanes, tornadoes, or blizzards), or water (from floods or tsunamis) and without proper shelter, exposure to these elements can lead to life-threatening conditions like hypothermia, heatstroke, or injury from debris.</p>
          <p>Limited Access to Food and Medical Supplies</p>
          <p>Communication and Isolation: You are on your own.</p>

          <h1>Challenges</h1>
          <p>Zombies, by definition, are a relentless threat. And that's not to mention the people that are left. They can be just as dangerous, if not more.</p>
          <p>Scarcity of resources in all definitions of the word. Find what you can and if you must take it.</p>
          <p>Psychological and Social Strain: Psychological strain can lead to a breakdown in group cohesion, infighting, and even violent behavior among survivors. Mental exhaustion and depression can impair survival instincts and judgment, making it harder to strategize, communicate, or maintain hope for the future.</p>
